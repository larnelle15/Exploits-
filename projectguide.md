So, it's not easy to hack into a computer. (Thankfully!) Modern computer systems have full Security Teams that are constantly working to patch and prevent vulnerabilities.

That's where metasploitable comes in. It's a Virtual Machine that has been purposefully left unpatched, so that people like us can use it to learn cybersecurity! Right now, we need to get the machine running. To let me run Metasploitable directly on my Azure Labs VM, I'll use a Docker Image.
You might be asking why I don't just use a second VM, Metasploitable is an Operating System in it's own right, and can absolutely be run as it's own VM. However, there's a couple issues we would run into if I tried to do that for this project:
1. Network access: I would have to make the two VMs (Ubuntu and Metasploitable) be able to talk to each other without anyone from the external internet being able to hack Metasploitable. Remember, Metasploitable is SUPER vulnerable to being hacked -- and that isn't just by me!
2. Azure limitations: Since i'm hosting my Ubuntu machine in Azure, I would also probably want to run my Metasploitable machines there. Unfortunately, Azure doesn't have any out-of-the-box Metasploitable support, so it would take hours to set up and some fancy software. Not worth it!

Here is my platfrom where all the "action" is gonna go down!
