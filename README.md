# Exploits!
"...I'm in."

It's the most traditional line of the hollywood hacker, and it says something about how we think about cybersecurity. People typically think it's all trying to gain access to someone else's computer. That's not always the case!

But today it is.

Today I'll be scratching the surface of penetration testing, in which I will purposefully try to gain access to a vulnerable system.

Here are just some of the phases of penetration testing in cyber security. By the end of this project, I will set up and run a provided docker image, Use nmap to check for open ports and ports vulnerabilities, and use the Metasploit framework to run pre-made exploits.
