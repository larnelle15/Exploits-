# Exploits!
"...I'm in."

It's the most traditional line of the hollywood hacker, and it says something about how we think about cybersecurity. People typically think it's all trying to gain access to someone else's computer. That's not always the case!

But today it is.

Today I'll be scratching the surface of penetration testing, in which I will purposefully try to gain access to a vulnerable system.

The Metasploitable virtual machine

By the end of this project, I will set up and run a provided docker image, Use nmap to check for open ports and ports vulnerabilities, and use the Metasploit framework to run pre-made exploits.

For more information on the VM configuration, here's the link to the metasploitable exploitability guide;
